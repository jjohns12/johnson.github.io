                        <div id="bio"><p> Hello, my name is Joshua Johnson and I am entering my sixth year as a high school social studies teacher at <a href="https://www.wbsd.org/westbloomfieldhs"
                                target="_blank">West Bloomfield High School</a>. 
                        In addition to working as a secondary social studies teacher, I coach middle school football, freshmen basketball and middle school track
                        within my district. To add, I have served as the sponsor for our black student union for the past four years.
                        I still have the same passion for learning as when I first entered the field; however, 
                        , I am at a point in my life where I would like to begin a family and enter a field with more room for growth.
                        Moreover, I firmly believe that the future of education will be driven by technology and 
                        I want to be a part of this revolution. With that being said, I believe diving into the world of coding will provide 
                        me with the skills and training necessary to do so. 
                        Not only will it allow me to expand my ability to maximize learning outcomes, 
                        but it will put me in a position to leverage these skills beyond public education as well. </p>

                                        friends, watching a good movie and and enjoy taking advantage of the various sights and surroundings the Metro-Detroit area has to
